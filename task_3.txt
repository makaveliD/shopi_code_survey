All these tasks we can did with options name, product images, and alt`s of images.
 For all media files (videos, images, etc.) we can add alt text after the "|" ( https://prnt.sc/10zx9et )
 which shows the duty of this file.
Examples:
 - "alt text | option:Red" - this media file can be loaded only when we select the red option
 - "alt text | option_swatch:Red" - this image will be displayed on the option swatch box
 if we need show hex code in a swatch, then we could add postfix for a color option like this https://prnt.sc/10zx2kd
 Also in liquid, we can check if color options have variant like in alt (3.2 in Code Survey)
 All images with empty alt, or alt which not matched to any rule will be displayed as usual
For all of these changes, we can create liquid scripts based on product options, images, and string filters.
But, if we want to create a more friendly interface we need to use meta fields ( require app installation for managing )

Both of these solutions haven`t bad impact on pagespeed, because neither of them uses javascript

All this functionality we can store in a snippet and render him in product page,
product snippet (for displaying these on collections page,cart,etc.)
